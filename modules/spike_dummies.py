"""
Automatic spike / outlier impulse-dummy detection.

Lets the user say "flag the top X% most unusual observations in the
dependent variable" (e.g. 10% of 100 rows -> 10 dummies) instead of hand-
picking individual dates. Each flagged observation gets its OWN single-period
impulse dummy column (1 at that row, 0 everywhere else) — these plug directly
into the existing `dummy_cols` / `DUMMY_COLS` mechanism already wired through
modules/params.py -> modules/statespace.py (own dedicated, mildly-persistent,
state-space beta per dummy column; see mcmc.py build_dynamics
/ `_build_process_noise`, which give every dummy state Ls=0.98 and a
comparatively large process-noise 5e-3 — i.e. its "beta" is essentially a
free, per-period level-shift the filter fits on its own, not something that
needs its own theta slot / optimizer bounds).

Detection method
-----------------
"Unusual" is judged relative to a local baseline, not the series' global
mean/level (so a genuine trend or seasonal swing isn't itself flagged as a
spike): a centered rolling-median baseline, then a robust (MAD-based)
z-score of the residual from that baseline. This only needs numpy/pandas —
no extra dependency — and is insensitive to the handful of huge outliers
it's specifically trying to find (unlike a mean/std z-score, which those
same outliers would drag around).
